            <li>AI detectors are a tool used to estimate the likelihood that selected content was generated by artificial intelligence. The detector does this by looking for patterns and structures to differentiate between AI-generated content and human produced work. AI-detectors are called “Classifiers” as they are machine learning models that are capable of categorizing data according to specific criteria. Popular AI detectors include QuillBot, Grammarly, Winston AI, and Originality AI.</li>
            <li>AI detectors receive large, labeled datasets containing a wide range of human-written and AI-produced content. Data engineers or “AI trainers” label these datasets as “human-written” or “AI-written” to give the algorithm a starting point. The algorithm is then fed even more data and told to differentiate. It differentiates between human and AI produced by analyzing specific patterns, such as sentence length and word usage frequency, from previous labelled data sets and identifying patterns between them. Should the system find similar patterns to AI-produced content from the labelled dataset, it will identify the sentence as AI-produced.</li>
            <li>The user is told whether the content written is AI-produced or Human-written by highlighting the pieces it has identified as AI-produced. Specific sentences could be highlighted or entire paragraphs could be highlighted if the piece of writing was completely produced by AI.</li>
            <li>These types of detectors are seeing an increased use in academic settings, such as High School, University, Graduate school, etc.</li>
            <li>In theory, this is a great tool for an academic setting. Instructors can detect cheating students and students are encouraged to produce their own original work. In reality, these detectors are inaccurate and result in false positives which have unintended consequences for students and instructors alike. AI tools can produce inaccurate information and on occasion even create made up facts if it can not find information on a certain topic.</li>
